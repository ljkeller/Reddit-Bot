# Reddit-Bot
############
This is a reddit bot in development, using Praw API and Python 3.6. I've used it to sift through comments (usually in subreddits), track keyworkds in comments/reply to those comments, and track redditor behavior like new submissions or comments. In its current form, it executes on my computers startup and outputs to the command prompt my friends most recent reddit comment. Whenever my friend comments next, it will output the message in the terminal and reply to his comment with a funny message.
