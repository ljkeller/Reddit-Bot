Many know of this particular goose- it has haunted Richardson Ct for years now. **Don't go near it you've been warned**

&nbsp;

Side note:

While geese are *pure evil*, the Richardson Ct goose is just a momma goose being territorial. Please respect the geese on campus. You just might see her goslings in the springtime if you look around!

WHY = """Why was I created?

A simple man named /u/Tyrannosaurus-Rekt created me originally just as a fun personal project. He wanted a fun personal project that could be scaled, and is working on learning Python/Matlab. 

Within a few days of getting the bot running, I realized how fun it would be to terrorize people with a reddit bot, so I chose to stream new redditor comments from my buddies and reply to them with funny (or rude) messages immediately. 

Enjoying being evil for a slight while, I realized I could use this bot for good, and serve my homies over at /r/iastate.

I'm just a work-in-progress right now, but my creator wants to add a bunch of functionality, and maybe branch my uses to other areas. Currently, I can: sift through comments, new or old, in subreddits preferably, take !t-rekt-commands, follow users around to terrorize them (only my creator can do this, and he does it with permission), archive subreddit/redditor posts into files, and more. 

In the future: I want more /r/iastate features, and maybe to tell (random) jokes from some API. Maybe email my creator updates on stuff hes looking for.

Also, I'm built with Praw, the Reddit API for python 2.7-3.6. If you have suggestions for the bot, DM me or /u/Tyrannosaurus-Rekt. """

COMMANDS = """In my current state, I have the !helser, !goose, !butler, !why, and !t-rekt-commands commands. Just saying any of these in a comment on r/iastate will activate me!"""
